Hello Fellow Humans and Hubots!

First, I want to say thanks for stopping by! Although I have been interested and dabbling in coding for over 20 years, this is the first time that I have fully commited myself to the exercise of learning to program.  I am starting with the basics (to me):  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  My hopeful end goal is to become a successfull and profitable web developer who owns his own business. I am currently learning through a couple of diffeent resources: Udemy, Google, Bing, and books (let me know if you have any good book recommendations!). Again I appreciate you taking the time to read this!
